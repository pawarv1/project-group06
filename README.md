To start, first pull/download content from this github repository and save it to your computer.
For the SQL code, simply use the createdb command and you MUST name the database "project"
After this, access the database by executing psql project, and once inside the database run the \i ProjectSchema.sql command.
This command will begin to copy, update, insert, drop tables into the database.
Use \q to exit out of psql.
Run the Flask code, to open the website, by executing export Flask_APP=app.py, and flask run, then open the link provided. 
Follow the Flask instructions given in Professor DeGood's github for further instructions: (https://github.com/jdegood/flask7dbs/blob/main/app.py).
Now you can enter a TAG into the first query or select one of the three qualities in the drop down menu of the second query and the website will give you those results from the database.
Happy Goating!
